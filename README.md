# QA Assessment

### Objectives

This repository is a simplified representation of our V2 backend APIs. It contains two branches - a `master` branch and a feature branch named `feature/authenticated-resource`. Your task is to branch off the feature branch, test the new feature, then merge your branch back into the feature branch. The branch you create should be named `feature/authenticated-resource-tests`.

### Project

In the `master` branch, there is only one route defined:

- GET /hello - a very simple health-check endpoint returning a greeting. This is to help you ensure the project is configured correctly.

In the `feature/authenticated-resource` branch, we have two new untested endpoints:

- `POST /auth/login` - an authorization endpoint. This endpoint relies on a v1 endpoint to validate credentials. For the purposes of this assignment, you can assume authorization is correctly implemented in v1 APIs.
- `POST /protected` - a protected resource. This endpoint should return a 401 status code unless the user's authorization is validated by V1.

### Scope Clarifications

- V1 is intentionally left unimplemented. Assume V1 is fully tested and operates according to logic used in `feature/authenticated-resource`.
- Any bugs found in the `feature/authenticated-resource` can be addressed in any of the following ways:
  - Produce a test which fails unless the bug is fixed
  - Create a branch which fixes the bug, merge that branch into `feature/authenticated-resource`, then sync `feature/authenticated-resource` into `feature/authenticated-resource-tests`
  - There is one bug intentionally included for you to find and address
- Coverage requirements are unspecified, but we would like to see test coverage as high as possible in the time allowed.

#### Constraints

- You may not modify `master`.
- Any changes to `feature/authenticated-resource` must be performed through merges to simulate reviewed pull requests.
- No additional packages should be required, but if you choose to install any, please provide an explanation of why they were added.

### Submission Requirements

- Send us a link to your submission inside a git repository
  - Show us you are comfortable working with git by keeping a detailed git history
- Please omit the company name from your repository/project name
- (Optional) We are always trying to improve the assessment experience for future candidates. When sending your submission, please provide some feedback on the assessment description including details such as:
  - How long the assessment took to complete
  - Whether or not the requirements were clear
  - On a scale of 1 - 10, the level of difficulty
  - If given the choice, would they rather have done an Leet-code style assessment over a project-based assessment

  Feedback on the assessment description will not affect our evaluation of your submission.
